This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About this project

This project was created as part of the evaluation in the Design and Technology subject, M.3, Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Secondary School.

## CUDSeeReg

This was made because of the problem of registering for additional subjects each semester. It is necessary to view information from the PDF files that the school have given, which is not convenient for viewing on different devices, especially phones. It is not easy to look at the date, time, and description of each subject. The font size is also very small.

All the subjects date and time on the website is from the school's PDF and Google Docs files.

! The website only displays the details on each subject. The registration process has do be done on _Dash badge_
